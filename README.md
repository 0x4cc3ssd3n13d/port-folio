# port-folio
"Probably Building the Future (or Blowing Something Up)." I turn caffeine and code into machines, ideas, and the occasional miracle. Passionate about tech, obsessed with innovation. If it doesn't exist yet, I'll make it. If it does, I'll make it better. Portfolio? Nah â€” think of this as a sneak peek into tomorrow.
